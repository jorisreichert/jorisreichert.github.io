									<h2 class="major">Introduction
									</h2>
									<p>
									Welcome to my fourth blogpost in the Big Data series. This blogpost is written to report my experiences on working with Spark SQL and the Spark Dataframe API in order to explore and analyze Open Data datasets. Just like last blogpost, I worked using Zeppelin Notebooks in the Zeppelin UI.
									</p><p>
									I followed <a href="https://rubigdata.github.io/course/assignments/A4-open-data.html">this assignment</a> that I was given for the Big Data course at the Radboud University. This blogpost however should be readable for anyone who wants to learn something about Spark SQL and the Spark Dataframe API. The notebooks I started with and the ones I ended up with are available on <a href="https://github.com/rubigdata/open-data-2021-jorisreichert">my github</a>.
									</p>
									<p>
									The data we will be working on in this blogpost (as is more closely described in notebook A4a as available on github) is <a href="https://opendata.nijmegen.nl/">open data of the city of Nijmegen</a>.
									</p>
									<h2 class="major">Getting started
									</h2>
									<p>
									In this assignment I continued working in Zeppelin Notebooks. This was easy as I could simply follow the second and third step I did in assignment three. 
									We start the container using:
									<pre><code>sudo docker start hey-spark</code></pre>
									(Note that depending on how you installed docker or on your session using sudo might not be necessary, it is for me though)
									</p>
									<p>
									Now, the Zeppelin UI is accessible from <a href="http://localhost:9001/"> port 9001</a>. That's it!
									</p>



									<h2 class="major">A4a - Data cleaning
									</h2>
									<p>
									The first Zeppelin notebook of this week, A4a, introduces us to the <code>Spark Dataset</code>, <code>Dataframe</code> and <code>Spark SQL</code>.</p>

									<h3>Real-life data</h3>
									<p>
									Just like in the Pandas dataframes that I've worked with before, we can use <code>df.show(x)</code> to show the first x rows of dataframe <code>df</code>. This can really help to get an impression of the data you're working with.
									</p>
									<p>
									Following instruction, we inspected some of the data using:<pre><code>val addrDF = bagdata.select('STRAAT, 'X_COORD, 'Y_COORD, 'WIJK_OMS)
addrDF.show(5, false)
addrDF.describe().show()</code></pre>
									The last of those commands did not manage to give us a mean of either the X or Y coordinate, which may be due to missing values. This is something we can check using <code>addrDF.filter(  $"X_COORD".isNull ).count</code> which showed us that there are 45 records that don't have an x coordinate. To inspect this data, we used
									</p><code>addrDF.filter( $"X_COORD".isNull ).show(45, false)</code><p>
									to inspect the street, x, y, and neighbourhood data without truncation. This gave us a well-readable list that showed the absence of an x coordinate is always paired with the absence of a y-coordinate and these records seem to occur all over Nijmegen and not in just one specific neighbourhood. As this has not yet satisfied our hunger for explanation, we also took a look at all columns (this time with truncation for readability) using
									</p><code>bagdata.filter( $"X_COORD".isNull ).show(45)</code><p>
									Now, we were able to observe a trend for these records, namely that the value for <code>STATUS</code> would most often be "<code>Niet autenthiek</code>", whatever that means. Because we had no intention of contacting anyone for further clarification and because this data accounted for only such a small amount of records (45/96867), we decided to just filter it away by defining a <code>cleanbagdata</code> that we can use from now on instead of bagdata:<pre><code>val cleanbagdata = bagdata.filter( ! $"X_COORD".isNull )</code></pre>
									</p>

									<h3>Schema: using types</h3>
									<p>
									Apparently the course thinks it's a better idea to move those 45 records to the origin (which I think unneccessarily messes with the mean). Anyway, in this section we have redefined <code>addrDF</code>, accounted for commas (not points) while transitioning x and y from strings to floats, and mapped the missing values to the origin. Anyway, time for some simple Q&A that the teacher expects in this blog:
									</p><p>
									Q: Did we use the Dataset or the Dataframe API in the cell above?
									</p><p>
									A: We used a Dataset, as we have defined <code>addrDF</code> as a Dataset. <b>Note:</b> we can use <code>.describe()</code> on a Dataset to return a dataframe.
									</p><p>
									Q: Why does <code>addrDF.describe().show()</code> still give <code>null</code> values?
									</p><p>
									A: Because although strings like street and quarter can be sensibly counted and ranked (to obtain a min and max), they are not numbers so we can't compute a mean or standard deviation of them.
									</p>

									<h3>Top 10 lists: Data Frame Operators VS Using SQL</h3>
									<p>
									Say we want to rank the quarters of Nijmegen from largest to smallest and display the top 10. We can do that using data frame operators or using SQL.
									</p> 

									<p>
									<i>Disclaimer: This paragraph is about query plans which I don't fully understand so this next part may not be true.</i> Using data frame operators we first did the grouping and counting. The ranking came second. Upon inspecting the query plan, we see that the second query plan looks very similar to the first, but the limit of 10 is applied in both the logical and physical plans. I can imagine this allows for earlier discarding of some data which might speed things up.
									</p>

									<h4>Data Frame operator code</h4>
									<p>
									<pre><code>val qc_1 = addrDF.groupBy("quarter").count.cache()
val qc_1_top = qc_1.orderBy(col("count").desc).limit(10)
qc_1_top.show()</code></pre>
									That's one way of doing it.
									</p>
									<h4>SQL code</h4>
									<p>
									<pre><code>addrDF.createOrReplaceTempView("addresses")
val qc_2_top = spark.sql("SELECT quarter, count(quarter) AS qc FROM addresses GROUP BY quarter ORDER BY qc DESC LIMIT 10")
qc_2_top.show</code></pre>
									This is another way of doing it. My assignment suggests that there would be an interesting difference in the query plan of these two methods, but I couldn't find it.
									</p>

									<p>
									The second Zeppelin notebook of this week, A4b, introduces us to using a combination of datasets.</p>

									<h3>Ran out of time, probably will be added on Tuesday.</h3>


              						<i>That's all, folks!</i>
              						I hope reading this blog taught you something new :)
